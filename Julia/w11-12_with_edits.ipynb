    "The dataset in its original form contains dataset types consistent with the *Open Neurophysiology Environment* (ONE) standard, which is part of a system proposed by the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) and colleagues with the aim of facilitating large-scale collaboration in neuroscience. Specifically, the main data consists of eight-probe Neuropixels recordings of spontaneous activity in three mice in the following format:\n",
    "- spks(k).st = time of spikes in seconds\n",
    "- spks(k).clu = neuron ID associated with each spike in st\n",
    "- spks(k).Wheights = height of each neuron on the probe [IS THIS `Wheights` or `heights`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Data from each mouse is stored in a **spks** which is a matlab structure with eight immediate children each corresponding to a probe. Therefore , $k$ ranges from 1 to 8. Supplementary data, such as labeling of the brain area based on location and information about the probes are also included. The following is an illustration of the probes inside a wire-mesh brain using location information of the probes in the Allen CCF framework. The probes have one of three colors, and each color is associated with one of the three mice.\n",

    "The following cells illustrate the spiking activity of neurons in each mouse. Note that the heatmaps were modified to only show whether spikes were detected: dark and bright pixels indicate the absence and presence of spikes. Although a sample for a neuron (an element in the spike train matrix) can have values greater than one, this is relatively rare. These values are sometimes high enough that the unaltered heatmap looks almost uniformly dark, which defeats the purpose of the illustrations. One option is to make the heatmap \"binary\", showing presence and absence of spikes and, as a result, one can easily see that the former is dominant in all three cases. Also of note is that we scale the x and y axes of the heatmaps based on the number of neurons involved and the length of the recording period to show the difference in size of data between the mice. Therefore, the range of the $x$ and $y$ axes are the same for all three mice. [I ADDED THIS SENTENCE. IS IT CORRECT? IF NOT, THAT MEANS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR COMMENT ABOUT SCALING THE X AND Y AXES OF THE HEATMAPS.]"
